* json-gen

A Clojure library designed to ... well, that part is up to you.

** Usage

Currently the API is lacking and all is hard coded, if you are on Emacs, please run these code blocks with ~C-c C-c~ to get up and running
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (compile "lein run")
#+end_src
This should output =output.json= in the root folder of the project. Please check if you have [[https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure][Clojure]] installed on your OS, also [[https://leiningen.org/][Lein]].

*** Developing
If you are on Emacs and wish to develop this application further, use Cider =M-x package-install RET cider RET=.
With Cider installed just run =M-x cider-jack-in-clj.=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (package-install cider)

  (if (null (require 'cidr nil t))
      (message "Not installed, please install CIDER")
      (progn
        (find-file "./src/json_gen/core.clj")
        (cider-jack-in-clj)))
#+end_src
You can also C-c C-c this code block for a somewhat automatic approach.
If you never worked with a REPL, you can run =M-x cider-load-buffer= or =C-c C-k= on the SRC buffer.
